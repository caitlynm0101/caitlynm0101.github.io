    Caitlyn is a young professional and social sciences researcher with
    consulting, editorial, and community development experience. Her interests
    broadly center around foreign language study and maintenance, the
    contemporary histories of South Asia and the Middle East, and human and
    civil rights. She was the former chair of the Wolf Humanities Center's
    Undergraduate Forum at the University of Pennsylvania, where she
    researched the intersection of language, affect, and civilian memories in
    East Pakistan before the Bangladesh Liberation War. Currently, she is
    drafting a textbook chapter on the history of East and West Pakistan, and
    she has a forthcoming publication on the social histories of Bengali-
    speaking Muslims in East Pakistan.
